# Wk5_BucketListProject

## Glasgow Bucket List

Build an app to track someone's progress at discovering Glagsow.

### MVP:

 * The app should allow the user to track areas and locations they want to visit and those they have visited.
 * Each area of the city should have one or more locations to visit.
 * The user should be able to create, edit and delete entries for places.
 * The app should allow the user to mark locations as visited or still to see.

### Extensions completed:

 * Have an About Glasgow section
 * Allow user to upload pictures (with url) when creating or editing a location
 * Have custom logo in the header that links to homepage
 * Have an additional Class for Categories
 * Can filter bucket by zones, places visited, entry fee, lockdown friendly, etc.
 * Landing page with instructions on how to use the app and some Glasgow celebs about
 * Clicking on circle can mark a place visited/not visited (bypassing edit page)
 * Both flex and grid styling used

### Instructions to run web app

 * Cloned repo should run under Flask at http://localhost:5000
 * Run the script on the same level as 'app.py' - flask run
